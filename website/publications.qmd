# Publications

[NKG2D Fine-Tunes the Local Inflammatory Response in Colorectal Cancer](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15061792)

[Chemotherapy-induced COX-2 upregulation by cancer cells defines their inflammatory properties and limits the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy combinations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29606-9)

[Tissue-resident FOLR2+ macrophages associate with CD8+ T cell infiltration in human breast cancer](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.02.021)

* In this study I carried out the human 'omics analysis. 
* I characterised the prognostic potential of FOLR2+ tissue resident macrophages in breast cancer. 

[RNA sensing via the RIG‐I‐like receptor LGP2 is essential for the induction of a type I IFN response in ADAR1 deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8922249/)

[Anti-inflammatory drugs remodel the tumor immune environment to enhance immune checkpoint blockade efficacy](https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1815)

[Antagonistic Inflammatory Phenotypes Dictate Tumor Fate and Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.10.020)

* This study formed a large part of my PhD in which I translated critical findings from syngeneic mouse models into human. 
* I performed all of the 'omics analysis in this paper identifying a Cyclooxygenase-2 activity related gene signature that was associated with patient prognosis and response to checkpoint inhibitors. 

[DNGR-1 limits Flt3L-mediated antitumor immunity by restraining tumor-infiltrating type I conventional dendritic cells](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-002054)
