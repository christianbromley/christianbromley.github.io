# Industry achievements 

## Owkin
* Developed and maintained 3 Snakemake pipelines that have been used to process multimodal data from >1500 patients from MOSAIC. 
* Led data science strategy for 1 internal target discovery programme that led to investment in wet lab experiments. 
* Built 2 machine learning pipelines from scratch for drug positioning and target identification that are now part of our client offerings. 
* Presented a poster at Spatial Biology UK conference. 

## Benevolent AI

* Delivered research report to AstraZeneca as tech lead on target discovery programme - work that ultimately led to target nomination. 
* Successfully managed to completion an intern working on multi-omics integration metho benchmarking. 
* Led an internal target discovery programme from conception, data science strategy, implementation and finally to the delivery of targets for validation by drug discovery teams.

* In this study I carried out the human 'omics analysis. 
* I characterised the prognostic potential of FOLR2+ tissue resident macrophages in breast cancer.

* This study formed a large part of my PhD in which I translated critical findings from syngeneic mouse models into human. 
* I performed all of the 'omics analysis in this paper identifying a Cyclooxygenase-2 activity related gene signature that was associated with patient prognosis and response to checkpoint inhibitors.
